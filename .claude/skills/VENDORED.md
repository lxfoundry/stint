# Vendored skills: provenance, local modifications, licences

Every skill in this directory is **vendored, not authored here**. They are general-purpose public
libraries: they hold no project-specific design, code or assets, and they are committed so the AI
workflow is reproducible and disclosed. Repo-specific guidance belongs in `CLAUDE.md`, never in
these files.

## Sources

21 skills come from three upstream repositories.

| Skills | Source | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `writing-plans`, `brainstorming`, `subagent-driven-development`, `executing-plans`, `requesting-code-review`, `receiving-code-review`, `finishing-a-development-branch`, `test-driven-development`, `systematic-debugging`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `verification-before-completion`, `writing-skills`, `using-superpowers` | [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) @ `b36e0829c6d0140e93cfef2ca599b1b07d4a7797` (2026-08-12) | MIT, © 2025 Jesse Vincent (text below) |
| `when-stuck`, `inversion-exercise`, `meta-pattern-recognition`, `collision-zone-thinking`, `scale-game`, `simplification-cascades`, `root-cause-tracing` | [obra/superpowers-skills](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-skills) @ `cdcd624ad3fd8026deb692e565351854569798dd` (2025-10-14) | MIT, © 2025 Jesse Vincent (same text) |
| `feature-planning` | [mhattingpete/claude-skills-marketplace](https://github.com/mhattingpete/claude-skills-marketplace), `engineering-workflow-plugin/skills/feature-planning` @ `b5b34bcf4c920bb72cee1c391b54a33cb5353c12` (2026-07-25) | Apache-2.0 (text below) |

Where a skill existed in both `obra` repos, the newer `obra/superpowers` copy was taken.
`root-cause-tracing` exists only in `superpowers-skills`, so it comes from there. Note that
`systematic-debugging` also bundles its own `root-cause-tracing.md` supporting doc, so that
material appears twice.

Skills added later for a specific ecosystem (a chain's official skill, for example) are listed
under [Ecosystem skills](#ecosystem-skills) at the end of this file.

### Problem-solving lineage

The six problem-solving skills (`when-stuck`, `inversion-exercise`, `meta-pattern-recognition`,
`collision-zone-thinking`, `scale-game`, `simplification-cascades`) were derived upstream from
agent patterns in the [Amplifier](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier) project (commit
`2adb63f858e7d760e188197c8e8d4c1ef721e2a6`, 2025-10-10):

- **From the `insight-synthesizer` agent:** `simplification-cascades`, `collision-zone-thinking`,
  `meta-pattern-recognition`, `inversion-exercise`, `scale-game`
- **Dispatch pattern:** `when-stuck` maps stuck-symptoms to the right technique

## Local modifications

The skills are vendored as plain project skills rather than as a plugin, which required the edits
below to the two `obra` sets. Upstream content is otherwise unchanged. `feature-planning` is
byte-identical to upstream; its unreferenced `references/planning-best-practices.md` was not
vendored.

1. **Frontmatter `name:` normalised to the directory name.** The `superpowers-skills` originals
   use title case with spaces (`Collision-Zone Thinking`, `Root Cause Tracing`, `When Stuck -
   Problem-Solving Dispatch`); Claude Code requires kebab-case matching the skill directory, so
   they would otherwise fail to load.
2. **`when_to_use:` folded into `description:`.** `description` is the field Claude Code reads
   for skill discovery, so the trigger text was appended to it rather than left in a field that
   is never consulted.
3. **`superpowers:<skill-name>` cross-references rewritten to bare names.** The plugin namespace
   does not resolve in a project install.
4. **`when-stuck` dispatch targets rewritten** from repo paths
   (`skills/problem-solving/scale-game`) to bare skill names.

### No worktrees (project decision)

These repositories do not use git worktrees. Skills that instructed the agent to create one now
say to create a dedicated branch instead:

- `executing-plans` (Step 1), `subagent-driven-development` (Setup), `writing-plans` (Context
  note): worktree creation → dedicated branch
- `requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md`: inspecting another revision now suggests
  `git archive` into a temp dir rather than `git worktree add`
- `using-git-worktrees` was **deliberately not installed**

`finishing-a-development-branch` retains its worktree *cleanup* logic. It self-detects
(`GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` → "normal repo, no worktree to clean up"), so here that path is inert.

Remaining `worktree` matches elsewhere are incidental: `WorktreeManager` is a class name in
unrelated example bug scenarios in `root-cause-tracing` / `systematic-debugging`, and
`using-superpowers/references/codex-tools.md` is a Codex-CLI-only reference file that Claude Code
never reads.

### Not installed

From the same upstream groups: `using-git-worktrees` (see above), `preserving-productive-tensions`
(architecture), `tracing-knowledge-lineages` (research), `defense-in-depth`,
`remembering-conversations`.

## Notes

- `using-superpowers` is designed to be force-loaded at conversation start by the upstream
  plugin's SessionStart hook. Since these are plain project skills with no plugin, that hook is
  reproduced locally: `.claude/hooks/session-start-superpowers.py`, wired up in
  `.claude/settings.json`. It reads the skill and emits it as `additionalContext` at every session
  start, and exits silently if the skill is ever removed. It needs `python` on PATH; without it the
  session still starts, with a hook error and without the skill injected. The skill's "Platform
  Adaptation" section lists Codex/Pi/Antigravity/Hermes reference files: none apply to Claude Code.
- `brainstorming`'s optional visual companion writes to `.superpowers/brainstorm/`, and
  `subagent-driven-development` to `.superpowers/sdd/`. `.superpowers/` is gitignored.
- `writing-plans` defaults to saving plans at `docs/superpowers/plans/`, and `brainstorming` specs
  at `docs/superpowers/specs/`. These upstream defaults are left unchanged in the skill files; the
  repo's `CLAUDE.md` overrides where plans and specs go.
- Eight files are scripts and are committed executable (`100755`): `brainstorming/scripts/start-server.sh`,
  `brainstorming/scripts/stop-server.sh`, `root-cause-tracing/find-polluter.sh`,
  `subagent-driven-development/scripts/{review-package,sdd-workspace,task-brief}`,
  `systematic-debugging/find-polluter.sh`, `writing-skills/render-graphs.js`.

## Ecosystem skills

### `solana-dev` (Solana Foundation)

| | |
|---|---|
| Source | [solana-foundation/solana-dev-skill](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-dev-skill), folder `skills/solana-dev/`, listed as Foundation-maintained on <https://solana.com/skills> |
| Pinned | tag `v2.7.0` = commit `674da5a4f2e071a61b89628871a462c20ad1928f` (commit date 2026-10-14); still the latest tag on 2026-10-16 |
| Vendored | 2026-10-16: `skills/solana-dev/` copied as is (33 files); `diff -r` against the clone is empty |
| Local modifications | None |
| Licence | MIT. The `LICENSE` file sits at the repository root and names no holder ("Copyright (c) 2026"); `SKILL.md` gives `metadata.author: Solana Foundation`. Text below, verbatim. |

**How it was reviewed:**
- Cloned at the tag into an isolated scratch folder. The installer was **not** run.
- `SKILL.md` at this commit was read in full on 2026-10-15.
- On 2026-10-16, the folder was grepped again for agent-directed instructions, and scanned for
  hidden Unicode and HTML comments: none.
- The matches are ordinary toolchain commands for a developer to run: the Surfpool installer
  (`curl -sL https://run.surfpool.run/ | bash`), cache-clearing `rm -rf` lines in
  `common-errors.md`, and an IDL upload command. Also matched: the skill's own key-handling rules.

**Interaction with this repo:** `SKILL.md`'s "Auto-install" section runs
`claude mcp add … solana-mcp-server` when no MCP server of that name is visible. `.mcp.json`
declares the server under exactly that name, so the check passes once the server is approved. See
`CLAUDE.md`.
